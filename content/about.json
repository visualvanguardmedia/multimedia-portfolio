  "bio": "I'm Jim Elli — a media lead and content creator with over 10 years of experience building audiences, growing channels, and producing social-first video across every major platform. I've grown YouTube channels from 20K to 1M subscribers, built Instagram audiences from zero, and scaled a brand to $100K in revenue through social media exclusively. I lead remote teams, create hands-on content, and think like a growth marketer who happens to be a world-class editor and colorist.",
