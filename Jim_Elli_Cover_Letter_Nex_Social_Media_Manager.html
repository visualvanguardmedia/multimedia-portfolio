Letter - Social Media Manager Position at Nex</h1>
<p><strong>Jim Elli</strong><br />

<hr />
<p>Dear Nex Hiring Team,</p>
<p>After exploring your mission to help families rediscover the joy of
movement and reviewing your award-winning Nex Playground system, I’m
excited to apply for the Social Media Manager position. Your approach to
combining technology with play to create meaningful family experiences
aligns perfectly with my passion for creating content that celebrates
movement, community, and authentic connection.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-nexs-cultural-impact">Understanding Nex’s Cultural
Impact</h2>
<p>Your recognition by Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies and
TIME’s Best Inventions isn’t just about product excellence—it’s about
cultural transformation. The way Nex Playground gets families moving
year-round, with safety and inclusivity as core considerations,
demonstrates the kind of purposeful innovation that inspires compelling
storytelling. Having read “Have Fun” and “Is Motion Gaming Back?”, I
understand that Nex isn’t just reimagining gaming; you’re reimagining
how families connect through movement.</p>
<h2 id="why-my-experience-fits-nexs-vision">Why My Experience Fits Nex’s
Vision</h2>
<p>As a multimedia professional with 10+ years of experience, I’ve built
my career around creating content that drives genuine engagement and
connection. My work with fitness brands like Rookie Run Club PT and Zao
Strength has taught me how to capture the energy of movement and
translate it into social content that motivates communities to get
active together.</p>
<p><strong>Content Creation Excellence:</strong> I’ve successfully
produced 150+ multimedia projects with a 4.9/5 client satisfaction
rating, specializing in the exact content types Nex needs—short-form
video for TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts. My fitness
content series increased client engagement by 63% through strategic
storytelling that celebrates the joy of movement and community
building.</p>
<p><strong>Platform-Native Expertise:</strong> My social media content
demonstrates deep understanding of platform nuances and cultural trends.
Whether it’s capturing high-energy training moments for Instagram Reels
or creating shareable community content for TikTok, I excel at making
content feel native to each platform while maintaining consistent brand
voice.</p>
<p><strong>Family &amp; Movement Focus:</strong> My experience creating
content around active lifestyles, community building, and wellness
perfectly aligns with Nex’s mission. I understand how to capture those
genuine family moments of play and discovery that make movement feel
like celebration rather than exercise.</p>
<h2 id="technical-skills-that-drive-results">Technical Skills That Drive
Results</h2>
<p>Your job description perfectly matches my technical toolkit: -
<strong>Creative Tools:</strong> Advanced proficiency in Adobe Creative
Suite, experience with CapCut for mobile-first editing, and Figma for
design collaboration - <strong>Content Strategy:</strong> Proven ability
to concept, brief, edit, and publish content across TikTok, Instagram,
YouTube Shorts, and LinkedIn - <strong>Performance
Optimization:</strong> Data-driven approach to content creation with
demonstrated ability to track analytics and optimize based on learnings
- <strong>Cultural Awareness:</strong> Deep understanding of internet
trends and ability to execute timely, culturally relevant content that
expands reach</p>
<h2 id="ready-to-grow-nexs-community">Ready to Grow Nex’s Community</h2>
<p>What excites me most about this role is the opportunity to help
position Nex as a brand that genuinely listens and engages
authentically. Your partnerships with Hasbro, Sesame Workshop, and
NBCUniversal provide incredible storytelling opportunities, and I’m
experienced in creating IP collaboration content that feels organic and
engaging.</p>
<p>I’m particularly drawn to your emphasis on cultural conversations and
authentic engagement. My experience building communities around movement
and wellness has taught me that the best social content doesn’t just
showcase products—it celebrates the transformative experiences those
products create for families.</p>
<h2 id="collaboration-growth-mindset">Collaboration &amp; Growth
Mindset</h2>
<p>The cross-functional nature of this role aligns perfectly with my
collaborative approach. I’ve worked closely with marketing teams,
designers, and product developers to create cohesive campaigns that
support launches and ongoing brand moments. My experience managing
multiple concurrent projects in fast-paced environments, combined with
my self-starter mindset, means I can own projects while iterating
quickly based on team feedback.</p>
<p>Your “product-driven culture that treasures talents and individual
growth” resonates with my professional philosophy. I’m excited about the
front-row seat to cutting-edge technologies in the evolving gaming field
and the opportunity to contribute to Nex’s mission while growing my
skills in motion gaming and family tech.</p>
<h2 id="ready-to-move-forward">Ready to Move Forward</h2>
<p>I’m based in Saint Paul, Minnesota, work remotely with professional
content creation infrastructure, and am flexible for occasional travel
to team offsites or filming needs. My portfolio at
multimedia-portfolio.netlify.app showcases the exact type of content
creation, motion graphics, and storytelling skills that will help Nex
build community and grow its audience.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering my application. I’d love to discuss how my
content creation expertise and passion for celebrating movement can help
Nex continue to inspire families to move more, play more, and have fun
together.</p>
