**Technical Excellence:**
Your job posting emphasizes the ability to follow shot lists while improvising better shots when available—this perfectly describes my approach. In my recent work with A. Parker's Garage Doors, I transformed a standard testimonial shoot into a compelling brand story by identifying creative angles and lighting opportunities that elevated the final product beyond the client's expectations.
